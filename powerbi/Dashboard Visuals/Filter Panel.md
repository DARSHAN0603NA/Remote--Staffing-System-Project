The Filter Panel provides interactive controls that allow users to dynamically refine the job market data displayed across the dashboard. It enables focused analysis by applying real-time filters without reloading or modifying the underlying data.

The following filters are available:

- **Job Location**: Allows users to filter job listings based on geographic location.
- **Experience Required**: Enables selection of roles based on experience level.
- **Employment Type**: Filters jobs by employment type such as full-time, part-time, or contract.

All filters are synchronized with the dashboard visuals, ensuring that KPIs, charts, tables, and analytics update instantly based on user selections. This improves usability and supports targeted recruitment analysis.
