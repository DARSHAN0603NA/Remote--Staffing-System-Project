The Dashboard Overview provides a comprehensive, interactive view of the job market using real-time and cleaned job listing data. It is designed to help users quickly understand recruitment trends, hiring patterns, salary insights, and skill demand across different roles and industries.

At the top of the dashboard, KPI cards present key metrics including:
- **Total Jobs**: Overall number of job openings available
- **Total Companies**: Number of companies actively hiring
- **Average Salary**: Average salary across job listings
- **UK Jobs Only**: Count of jobs available specifically in the UK

The dashboard includes multiple visual components for detailed analysis:
- **Job Roles Breakdown**: Displays the distribution of job roles across different categories
- **Geographic Distribution of Jobs (UK)**: Visualizes job concentration across UK regions
- **Top UK Companies Hiring**: Highlights companies with the highest number of job openings
- **Top Skills Required by Employers**: Shows the most in-demand skills based on job listings
- **Employment Type Overview**: Compares full-time, part-time, and contract roles
- **Job Roles by Industry**: Illustrates how job roles are distributed across industries

A live job listings table at the bottom provides detailed, row-level information including company name, job title, location, salary range, experience required, and employment type.

All visuals are dynamically connected to the filter panel, allowing users to refine results based on location, experience level, and employment type. This enables focused analysis and supports data-driven recruitment decisions.
